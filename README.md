# 🧠 Data Science Project: [Google Calendar Extractor]

## 📌 Overview

This project leverages modern data science techniques and tools to derive actionable insights from real-world data. The primary goal was to [create a repository to store past events from calendar so that we do not have to navigate through googles system to find information from years ago.], and deliver results that can guide informed decisions and continuous improvement.

## 🧪 Data Science Techniques

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Conducted detailed univariate and multivariate analysis, identified trends, anomalies, and patterns in data using interactive visuals and statistical summaries.

- **Feature Engineering**  
  Created meaningful variables such as tenure buckets, performance scores, and categorical encodings to improve model performance.

- **Data Cleaning & Imputation**  
  Addressed missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Applied mean/median imputation, domain-specific correction, and standardization.

- **Model Development & Evaluation**  
  Trained various ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting. Evaluated using metrics like ROC-AUC, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.

- **Statistical Testing**  
  Performed hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA), multicollinearity checks (VIF), and significance testing to validate assumptions.

- **Workflow Automation**  
  Used Python scripts and APIs to automate data extraction, transformation, and reporting workflows, reducing manual time and errors.

- **Dashboarding & Reporting**  
  Created executive dashboards to communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders, including key metrics, trends, and recommendations.

- ✅ **Improved Decision-Making**  
  Provided clear, data-driven insights to guide strategy and operations across departments.

- 💰 **Cost Savings**  
  Automated manual tasks, resulting in an estimated savings of $1,200 per year.

- 🔍 **Operational Visibility**  
  Surfaced key metrics and KPIs that were previously inaccessible or inconsistently tracked.

- 🔄 **Repeatability**  
  Designed modular scripts and pipelines that can be reused or adapted across future datasets or projects.

- 📊 **Business Value**  
  Enabled [Territory Managers] to [recall past events — reducing time, resources, slow data loading, and more.]
